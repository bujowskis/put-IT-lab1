3 Frequency of letters:
	- characters are not equally likely.
	- the most probable characters are:	' ', 'e', 't', 'o', 'a', 'i'
	- the least probable characters are:	'z', 'q', 'x' 'j'
	- the similarity is, the most frequent letters are encoded using the least amount of signals in Morse code, and the number of signals used to encode a chaacter increases with the decrease of occurrence frequency
	- this relationship makes sense - it decreases amount of signals used to send a whole message

4 First order approximation
    - the words average about 5-6 most of the time
    - some variations may occur (e.g. I managed to get 4 and 7 after few tries) but are unlikely

6 Approximations based on Markov sources
    - first order markov source - 5-8 characters on average, but this one tends to vary the most
    - third order markov source - 4-6 characters on average
    - fifth order markov source - 5-8 characters on average
